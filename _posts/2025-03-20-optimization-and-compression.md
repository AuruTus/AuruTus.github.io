## Optimization and Compression

When it comes to optimization, people often need find a pattern of computation or storage access.

These patterns should have some commonality to reduce the redundant steps to get a shorter path towards the same target, which is so similar with how we compress the data to for storage and transport.The elimination of conditinal branch, IO locality, and even more better algorithms, all show such astonishing characteristic. ðŸ¤”
